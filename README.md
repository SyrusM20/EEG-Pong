# EEG-Pong
This was a group project for NeurAlberaTech NATHACKS 2023 hackathon.

Our goal was to change the difficulty of a game using EEG data from the user. We use the Alpha-Gamma ratio in a power-band function to determine challenge in the user.

If you are on Windows: change the serial port in Live_Stream.py to COM3. On Linux: try /dev/ttyACM0. The port varies between devices.
